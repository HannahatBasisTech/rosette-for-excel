# About Rosette for Excel  
Rosette for Excel is a product developed by [Basis Technology Corp.](basistech.com) to make the features of the Rosette API available to Excel users without the need to write any of their own code. The Rosette API is a tool for accessing Basis Technology’s natural language processing text analysis services. 
# How to Install  
To install, copy both the `rosette.application` file and the folder (titled with the version number) to your personal computer. Run `rosette.application`, which may ask for permission to install the add-in. When you next open Excel you will see Rosette in the ribbon. 
#Getting Started
Before you can make any calls with either formulas or the ribbon, you’ll need to add a Rosette API key using the dialog found on the ribbon. Head to [developer.rosette.com](developer.rosette.com) to get your free Rosette API key. Enter your key and check your connection with the Rosette API by clicking Check Key. If a green check appears, you’re good to go! An alternate URL can be specified for On Premise users, but is not required. A more in-depth explanation of how to make API calls can be found [here](UseInfo.md).
